# Weather App

This project is meant to teach me how to use API keys as well as asynchronous JavaScript. The UI of this app is NOT good, I'm aware of that. UI is not the focus of this app and this is a small, simple app, so I have not put much time into the UI nor do I care to.

Put a location into the search bar and click the submit button to get current weather information of that area or a nearby area. Click the temperature toggle button to switch the display temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

P.S. This app is a part of The Odin Project's course.
